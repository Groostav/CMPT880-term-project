Ok, so, to generate regressionTest and regressiontest0 I ran this

java -cp ./* randoop.main.Main gentests --testclass=java.util.TreeSet

worth nothing the second text file here, there are a huge list of options
but one big deal is that they use JUnit assertions

My previous plan was to copy-paste sections out of the tests into a static main method for intruder,
but perhalps its simpler to use JUnit to drive intruder...
